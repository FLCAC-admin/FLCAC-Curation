# Flow Mapping

Flow mapping is the process of relating {term}`elementary  flows <elementary  flow>` in one dataset to similar flows in another dataset. In the context of the Federal LCA Commons, typically users are mapping the elementary flows in a third-party dataset (such as Ecoinvent or a dataset from the openLCA Neuxs) to the {term}`Federal Elementary Flow List` (FEDEFL).

:::{note} Technosphere flows
Flow mapping can also be performed on {term}`technosphere flows <technosphere flow>`, for example when identifying an alternate source of background LCI data.

Flow mapping is a critical step for accurate and complete {term}`LCIA <Life Cycle Impact Assessment>` flow characterization when using multiple LCI repositories in a single project database. In order for LCIA methods available on the FLCAC to fully capture the elementary flows present in a project database or product system they must be mapped to the {term}`FEDEFL <Federal Elementary Flow List>` as this flow list is the basis of LCIA methods on the commons.
