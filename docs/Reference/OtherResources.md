## Flow Mapping

Flow mapping is the process of relating elementary or technosphere flows in one dataset to similar flows in another dataset. In the context of the FLCAC, typically users are mapping a third-party dataset (such as Ecoinvent or the National Emissions Inventory [NEI]) to the federal elementary flow list (FEDEFL) or an alternate source of background LCI data in the case of technosphere flows. 

Flow mapping is a critical step for accurate and complete LCIA flow characterization when using multiple LCI repositories in a single project database. In order for LCIA methods available on the FLCAC to fully capture the elementary flows present in a project database or product system they must be mapped to the FEDEFL as this flow list is the basis of LCIA methods on the commons.
