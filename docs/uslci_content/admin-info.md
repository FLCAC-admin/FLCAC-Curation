## Administrative Information

| Field Name | Convention | Examples |
|:---:|:-----|:---------|
|(M) Intended application|Use one of the four Main Goal Situations below to describe how the process is intended to be used. The term, "Main Goal Situations," refers to an LCA study's primary intended purpose per the [ILCD Handbook’s Detailed Guidance](http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC48157/ilcd_handbook-general_guide_for_lca-detailed_guidance_12march2010_isbn_fin.pdf). Additionally, you should indicate the target audience and the context for which the model was built (e.g., carbon footprint, Environmental Product Declaration (EPD), policy development, policy information, generic unit process data, etc.). Indicate the completeness level of the elementary flows such that users can interpret the correct application of LCIA methods to the dataset. If the data were originally developed and analyzed with a LCIA method, indicate the method utilized here. If these data are an update to a previously published dataset, a note should be included here.<br><br>**SITUATION A -- MICRO-LEVEL DECISION SUPPORT**<br>_The intended application for this process is for micro-level decision support as described in Goal Situation A from the ILCD Handbook's Detailed Guidance. LCA studies with this intended application are often used to answer product-related questions. Decisions stemming from these LCA studies "are assumed to have only limited or no structural consequences outside the decision-context,...do not change available production capacity...[and do not cause] large-scale consequences in the background system or other parts of the technosphere[.]"_<br><br>**SITUATION B -- MESO/MACRO-LEVEL DECISION SUPPORT**<br>_The intended application for this process is for meso/macro-level decision support as described in Goal Situation B from the ILCD Handbook's Detailed Guidance. LCA studies with this intended application are often used to support strategic level decisions such as "raw materials strategies, technology scenarios, policy options, etc. [Such decisions] are assumed to [result in] large-scale consequences in the background system or other parts of the technosphere."_<br><br>**SITUATION C1 -- ACCOUNTING**<br>_The intended application for this process is for accounting purposes as described in Goal Situation C1 from the ILCD Handbook's Detailed Guidance. LCA studies with this intended application offer "purely descriptive documentation of the system under analysis (e.g., a product, sector or country), without being interested in any potential consequences on other parts of the economy.” The studies categorized under Goal Situation C1 do consider existing benefits outside the analyzed system such as recycling._<br><br>**SITUATION C2 -- ACCOUNTING**<br>_Same as in SITUATION C1 except LCA studies categorized under Goal Situation C2 do NOT consider existing benefits outside the analyzed system such as recycling._|These data are an update to the 2007 dataset with the same process name.<br><br>**SITUATION A -- MICRO-LEVEL DECISION SUPPORT**<br>_The intended application for this process is for micro-level decision support as described in Goal Situation A from the ILCD Handbook's Detailed Guidance. These data were developed as specific, average or generic unit process LCI results for use in answering internal company product-related questions. A full inventory of environmental flows are included, thus this unit process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories, on the fate and transport considerations have been applied. The original study results were analyzed using the TRACI LCIA factors._|
|(M) Data set owner|Name of the person or entity that owns the dataset directly from which the process was generated. The data set owner is often the data commissioner but not necessarily the copyright holder, if the dataset is copyrighted. The field is populated from the list of Actors in the openLCA navigation tree [(To add a new Actor, See: Example Adding an Element in openLCA)](../04-resources/04-App-F.md)|_Kodak Alaris_|
  |(M) Data generator|Name of the person or entity responsible for generating the dataset from which the process was generated or for updating of the data. The field is populated from the list of Actors in the openLCA navigation tree.|_Sustainable Solutions Corporation_|
  |(M) Data documentor|Name of the individual or entity that transformed the dataset into the published openLCA version of this dataset, i.e., Actor responsible for formatting and submitting the data to USLCI.  The field is populated from the list of Actors in the openLCA navigation tree.|_Sustainable Solutions Corporation_|
  |(M) Publication|Reference to an openLCA Source that illustrates how the processes' LCI data were developed and/or used, i.e., a foundational publication that illustrates how the data are used. The Citation should use the American Psychological Association (APA)  format.|_Sustainable Solutions Corporation. (2016). IMA-NA Calcium Carbonate Life Cycle Assessment_|
  |(A) Access and use restrictions|This field is populated by NREL. It contains legal language about how the dataset may be used.|_See [Appendix A: Data Use Disclaimer Agreement (“Agreement”)](../04-resources/04-App-A.md)_|
  |(O) Project|Information about the project in which the data were generated. Where applicable, this field should indicate the project name, funding institution(s) or organization(s), and the grant or contract names and numbers.|_This project was supported by the Biomass Research and Development Initiative, grant no. 2011-10006-30357 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture._|
  |(A) Creation date|The date and time when the dataset was published to the USLCI. The date format is _MM/DD/YY HH: MM AM/PM_. This field will be automatically generated when the dataset is published to the USLCI.|_6/1/18 12:45 PM_|
  |(M) Copyright|The openLCA software has a checkbox that will indicate whether the dataset is copyrighted. Most processes published in the USLCI are not copyrighted. Leave the box unchecked.|_Blank_|
