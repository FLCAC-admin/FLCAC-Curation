# Terms and Acronyms Common to the Federal LCA Commons
The list of terms and acronyms is alphabetical according to 'Full Name'. Not all terms have an associated abbreviation or acronym. Single quotes are used to denote defined terms when deemed helpful.  

|Acronym or Abbreviation| Full Name| Definition or Descriptive Link
|----|----|----
|Argonne|Argonne National Laboratory|Visit Argonne's [homepage](https://www.anl.gov/) or their [GREET Tool](https://greet.anl.gov/results)
|-|collaboration server|An openLCA specific server application, maintained by GreenDelta, that allows users to work collaboratively on LCA models, share data, and host public LCA repositories such as those available on [lcacommons.gov](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/). For more information, see [GreenDelta's Collaboration Server 
|-|context|In the case of the FEDEFL (and often in LCA more broadly), context describes the origin or destination of an elementary flow. Context informs the directionality of an elementary flow. Resource flows are extracted from nature, while emissions are released to nature. [List of FEDEFL contexts](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/blob/master/wiki/resources/FEDEFLcontexts.xlsx). For more discussion of context see [EPA's FEDEFL Report](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=347251&Lab=NRMRL&simpleSearch=0&showCriteria=2&searchAll=elementary+flows&TIMSType=Published+Report&dateBeginPublishedPresented=07%2F31%2F2019)
|database|project database|In the context of the FLCAC, the term project database is used to refer to a collection of background and foreground LCA processes, flows, product systems. LCIA methods and other data objects as developed by an LCA practitioner(s). A project database is often composed of one or more 'repositories' and novel foreground LCI models that are typically the basis of 'product systems' under study. The goal of the FLCAC is to provide background data and a community of practice to inform consistency in developing project databases. 
|DALY|Disability-Adjusted Life Years|"One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health. DALYs for a disease or health condition are the sum of the years of life lost to due to premature mortality (YLLs) and the years lived with a disability (YLDs) due to prevalent cases of the disease or health condition in a population." from [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/158#:~:text=Definition%3A-,One%20DALY%20represents%20the%20loss%20of%20the%20equivalent%20of%20one,health%20condition%20in%20a%20population.)
|-|elementary flow|  A material (resource), energy or space that is exchanged with the biosphere. An elementary flow is characterized by a unique combination of 'flowable' and 'context' information and is assigned a 'UUID'.
|endpoint|endpoint indicator|A category of LCIA indicator that expresses characterized impact in terms of damage caused to an area of concern such as the natural environment, human health or resource supply. An example of an endpoint indicator would be the human health impact of particulate matter formation potential expressed in 'Disability-Adjusted Life Years'.
|EPD|Environmental Product Declaration|A third-party verified report of the environmental impacts of a product. EPDs are developed according to ISO 14025 and the relevant 'product category rule' for that product type. For more information see the [FHWA EPD Tech Brief](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/sustainability/hif21025.pdf)

|-|functional unit| The reference unit of a 'product system' within LCA. Results are run and compared on the functional unit. [ISO 14040](https://www.iso.org/standard/37456.html)
|ISO|International Organization for Standardization|An [independent, non-governmental body](https://www.iso.org/structure.html) with members from national standards boards that develops standard procedures for technical processes, such as life cycle assessment. 
|JSON|JavaScript Object Notation|"A lightweight data-interchange format" from [json.org](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). JSONs are used to house LCA-related data objects within openLCA.
|lib|library| A type of data package limited to read-only access, intended to serve as a dependency of another data package. The library feature in openLCA 2.0 and later versions enables the use of databases together without the need to import them on top of one another. Processes and other elements that are part of a library database are not editable but can be utilized as part of processes or product systems in the main database.
|LCA|Life Cycle Assessment| [United Nations description of environmental LCA](https://www.lifecycleinitiative.org/starting-life-cycle-thinking/life-cycle-approaches/environmental-lca/)
|midpoint|midpoint indicator|"A characterization method that provides indicators for comparison of environmental interventions at a level of cause-effect chain between emissions/resource consumption and the endpoint level." from the European Commission report [Indicators and targets for the reduction of the environmental impact of EU consumption: Overall environmental impact (resource) indicators](https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/JRC92824_qms_h08_lcind_deliverable3_final_20141113.pdf). A common example of a midpoint indicator is global climate change potential where impacts are expressed as kg CO<sub>2 </sub>equivalents.
