|-|context|In the case of the FEDEFL (and often in LCA more broadly), context describes the origin or destination of an elementary flow. Context informs the directionality of an elementary flow. Resource flows are extracted from nature, while emissions are released to nature. [List of FEDEFL contexts](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/blob/master/wiki/resources/FEDEFLcontexts.xlsx). For more discussion of context see [EPA's FEDEFL Report](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=347251&Lab=NRMRL&simpleSearch=0&showCriteria=2&searchAll=elementary+flows&TIMSType=Published+Report&dateBeginPublishedPresented=07%2F31%2F2019)
