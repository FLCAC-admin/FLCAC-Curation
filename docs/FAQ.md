# Frequently Asked Questions

 <summary><b>How do I align my dataset with the Federal Elementary Flow List?</b></summary>

All data on the Federal LCA Commons must use elementary flows that conform to the [Federal Elementary Flow List](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=347251).
For instructions on mapping your flows, see [here](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist/wiki/Getting-Started-with-FEDEFL#mapping-a-dataset)

 <summary><b>How do I find Impact Assessment Methods?</b></summary>

Impact assessment methods aligned with the Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) and Federal LCA Commons data are available in two forms:
- [LCIA Methods without flows](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lcia-methods-without-flows): These JSON-LD files do not contain the flow objects, only the characterization factors. They can be downloaded and imported into any openLCA database.
- LCIA Methods repositories: Repositories are available for TRACI2.1 and ReCiPe which contain the methods and all relevant flow objects. These repositories are useful for reviewing all characterization factors for flows in the FEDEFL
