# Appendix C – Existing LCI Databases

In 1993, President Clinton&#39;s EO 1287316-Federal Acquisition, Recycling, and Waste Prevention promoted waste prevention, recycling, and green procurement. The EPA responded with increased research efforts into the science of LCA. This agency also established LCI guidelines and principles in a 1993 publication,17 which were a forerunner to the principles and framework standard first published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 199718. The US EPA also developed the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts (TRACI), a collection of characterization factors for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) phase of LCA that are reflective of US conditions. In 1996, the DOE&#39;s ANL used the LCA approach to create the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) tool, which may be used to evaluate the well-to-wheel impacts of fuel and vehicle life cycles. The USLCI Database project began in 2001 when the US DOE directed NREL and the Athena Institute to explore the development of a national public database. The US LCI Database has been publicly available at [www.nrel.gov/lci since 2003](http://www.nrel.gov/lci%20since%202003). The project strives to provide publicly available LCI data following a consistent protocol, thus allowing users to objectively review and compare data based on similar data collection and analysis methods. As the LCA methodology has developed through the years, various Federal agencies have increasingly utilized the approach and developed tools to guide technical assessments.

Each of the existing commercial databases has a collection of detailed economic processes (some overlapping) but several are also narrowly focused and most are prohibitively expensive. Further, the commercial databases often utilize government data that are made available to the public as part of their information base. The ecoinvent database is the largest, most comprehensive LCI database to date. The ecoinvent LCI database, currently managed by a not-for-profit association, has been used extensively to model European conditions and support LCA in EU decision-making. This database, began as a joint initiative of a private consulting firm and Swiss Federal Offices in the 1990&#39;s as a solution to uncoordinated efforts by various institutions. However, while there are international datasets for electricity production and some other background processes, the datasets are largely compiled for the European geographic scope. The GaBi database, another extensive collection of LCI data, has largely been compiled based on proprietary industry data. Therefore, this database contains a great number of aggregated datasets (i.e., proprietary) a format that intrinsically lacks transparency and reproducibility.

The lack of a centralized public repository prevents widespread use of the LCA methodology for decision-making. Many databases have limited inventories; especially transportation LCA tools. These databases inventory only energy requirements, greenhouse gases, and emissions that are mandated in regulations (e.g., criteria air pollutants)—leaving materials, chemical, water, and solid waste requirements as data gaps. As mentioned, completeness, accessibility and interoperability are key to developing and linking LCI data into information systems. Per Saynajoki 2017, even building industry policy based on LCA may not yet be reliable due to &quot;lack of transparency in the field,&quot; which results from variations in methodological and subjective choices by practitioners.
