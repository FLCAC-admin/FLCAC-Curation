ðŸš§ **This site is under construction. New content will continue to be added** ðŸš§

Welcome to the Federal LCA Commons documentation site.
Here we provide guidance and resources for accessing data from the Federal LCA Commons (www.lcacommons.gov).

This site is generated with [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) from content stored on the [FLCAC-Curation GitHub repository](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-Curation).

A table of contents is provided in the left sidebar or on narrow screens can be accessed with the menu icon (three horizontal bars) at the top-left corner.

# Contributing to the docs

We appreciate your interest in adding to shared resources for the LCA community!

To contribute content to these docs, please [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) the [FLCAC-Curation repository](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-Curation), commit your edits, then [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with a clear description of your work.

The FLCAC Data Curation team is actively reorganizing existing resources and updating guidance to make sure it is clear and accessible. Feedback on these efforts is always appreciated. Thank you!

# Issues and Discussions
[**Issues**](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-Curation/issues) are generally intended to report errors and request improvements related to the documentation.
It is helpful if issues have a clear path towards resolution.
Please [apply labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-label) to issues to help keep them organized. The list of available labels can be viewed via the Labels button on the Issues tab (e.g., [FLCAC-Curation labels](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-Curation/labels)).

For topics with a wider scope or where more discussion may be required to reach a resolution, please post it as a [**Discussion**](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-Curation/discussions).
Please apply labels to help keep the discussion list organized.
Discussions rely on the same set of repository-specific labels used by Issues.
